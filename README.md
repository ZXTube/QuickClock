# QuickClock

Quick Clock helps you see the time as quickly as possible.

It's made so that you choose a shortcut for it and right when you click that shortcut the time and date appear like this:

and when you press ESC it will close

To set it up you just need to download and extract the QuickClock.zip folder (Which you'll find after clicking the releases button on the right)
Right click on the shortcut called "QuickClock" in the extracted folder and click properties, then set the shortcut key to whatever you want

In my case I made it because my screen is broken from the bottom corner, so I can't see the time or date and had to make this

Note, if the shortcut takes like 5-10 seconds to open then [this](https://superuser.com/questions/426947/slow-windows-desktop-keyboard-shortcuts) is probably the reason

Thanks
